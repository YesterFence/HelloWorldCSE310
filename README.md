<!-- Hello, My name is Ryan Lee. I am here to demonstrate my knowledge in programing a print statement in Python.
I am using Python because it is a well known language and one I would like to practice more with. 
In this example, I am using Python to print a statment, Hello World. In my code, you can see it is written in portuguese. 
When we run the program, we can see in the terminal 'Bom Dia ao Mundo'. 
I hope this simple demonstration helps explain how programing in python works.  -->
